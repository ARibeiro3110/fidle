## A propos

This repository contains all the documents and links of the **Fidle Training**.  

The objectives of this training, co-organized by the Formation Permanente CNRS and the SARI and DEVLOG networks, are :
 - Understanding the **bases** of deep learning neural networks (Deep Learning)
 - Develop a **first experience** through simple and representative examples
 - Understand the different types of networks, their **architectures** and their **use cases**.
 - Understanding Tensorflow/Kera**s and Jupyter lab** technologies on the GPU
 - Apprehend the **academic computing environments** Tier-2 (meso) and/or Tier-1 (national)

## Available at this depot:
You will find here :
 - the support of the presentations
 - all the practical work, in the form of Jupyter notebooks
 - sheets and practical information :
   - **[Configuration SSH](../-/wikis/howto-ssh)**



## Installation
To run this examples, you need an environment with the following packages :
 - Python >3.5
 - numpy
 - Tensorflow 2.0
 - scikit-image
 - scikit-learn
 - Matplotlib
 - seaborn
 - pyplot

You can install such a predefined environment :
```
